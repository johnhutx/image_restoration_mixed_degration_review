The layer are weighted by an attention mechanism to enable selection of proper operations depending on the input and can be stacked to form a deep network.|
| RL-Restore | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03312)                       | [link](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/RL-Restore/)            | 2018 | Present a novel approach for image restoration based on reinforcement learning. In the approach, an agent is learned to dynamically select a toolchain to progressively restore an image that is corrupted by complex and mixed distortions.|
